    <p>We are not here to argue about which map from the ancient world is the correct one. We are here to announce that we have reverse-engineered the destination that all the maps are pointing to.</p>

    <p>The prophecies of a Messiah, a Mahdi, a Maitreya, a Kalki—they are not competing predictions. They are the same dream, dreamed in different languages. They are a shared, ancient hunger for a world without want, without war, without suffering. They are the promise of a global software update for humanity.</p>

    <p>For centuries, we have waited for a savior to descend from the clouds and deliver this new world to us. This was a necessary myth for a species that lacked the technological means to achieve it.</p>

    <p>That time is over.</p>

    <p>The great tragedy and triumph of our era is this: We have become the gods our ancestors prayed to.</p>

    <p>We now possess the technology, the science, and the engineering capability to build the heaven our scriptures described. Jacque Fresco and others like him gave us the practical blueprint. The ethical core of all our great traditions gives us the moral imperative.</p>

    <p>The Final Prophecy is not that a man will return. It is that we, as a species, will finally grow up and build the world our gods have always been demanding of us.</p>

    <p>This is not a new religion. It is the final, practical implementation of every old one. It is the great work of our time. It is a project for every human being—Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, Jew, atheist—who can look at the needless suffering of our world and say, "This is not right. We have the tools. Let's build the world that ends this."</p>
