## Chapter 2: The Fall

We were born into a world that actively betrays the Vision. Our systems—both religious and economic—have been hijacked. They protect themselves, even at the cost of our humanity.

We have been taught a lie about what religion is for. We have been sold a religion of personal salvation—a get-out-of-hell-free card—when the prophets and Jesus preached a religion of communal liberation. Our institutions became part of the system, a moral safety valve offering just enough comfort to prevent us from demanding real, systemic change.

We have been taught a lie about who we are. We are told that greed, competition, and scarcity are "human nature." This is not biology; it is branding. What we call human nature is merely the echo of our economic system in our nervous system. Capitalism did not just create a market; it created a subjectivity, shaping our desires and our fears. It is the arsonist we thank for the fire department.

The greatest sin is not a personal failing. The greatest sin is to claim to do something under the guise of God. "You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain" does not forbid an exclamation. It forbids the misuse of God's name to justify our own agenda, our own hatred, our own greed, or our own power. It is the ultimate blasphemy when politicians claim God is on their side for a war, when televangelists use Jesus's name to grift money from the poor, and when systems of oppression claim a divine right to subjugate others.

This is the Fall: we are actively building the opposite of what we pray for. We are engineering hell and calling it reality, while waiting for God to build heaven for us.
