## Chapter 1: The Vision

There is a horizon toward which all of humanity has been striving. We call it by many names: Utopia, The Kingdom of God, Shalom, The Messianic Age, Nirvana. It is the concept of a world without the needless suffering born from scarcity and fear.

This vision is not a destination to be arrived at, but a direction to be oriented by. Every step we move toward it, it moves further away, for the potential for betterment is infinite. All we can ever do is better than yesterday, and hope that tomorrow we do better than today. Our victory is not in arriving, but in the relentless, forward-focused striving. The walking is the point.

This shared dream is the fingerprint of the divine on the human soul. The promise of a Messiah, a Mahdi, a Maitreya, a Kalkiâ€”these are not competing claims. They are the same dream, dreamed in different languages. They are humanity's shared hunger for a world where justice rolls on like a river and righteousness like a never-failing stream.

The vision is not a promise of a future afterlife for the individual, but a call to build a present paradise for the collective. It is the sacred work of engineering a world where it is easier for people to be good.
