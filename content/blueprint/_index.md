## The Fresco/Jesus Synthesis

<p>
The Universal Blueprint emerges from a radical synthesis: the visionary ethics of Jesus of Nazareth, stripped bare of institutional dogma, and the pragmatic elegance of a Resource-Based Economic Design, devoid of capitalist exploitation. This is not merely a philosophical exercise but a practical framework for planetary transformation.

<p>
Jesus's core teachings—radical compassion, selfless service, systemic justice, and the profound interconnectedness of all life—provide the moral bedrock. His parables are not just spiritual allegories but blueprints for societal organization, emphasizing sharing, equitable distribution, and the dismantling of oppressive structures. The "least of these" are not an afterthought but the focal point of a truly just system.

<p>
A Resource-Based Economic Design (RBE), as advocated by figures like Jacque Fresco, offers the scientific and logistical scaffolding. It posits that all Earth's resources are the common heritage of all people, to be managed intelligently, sustainably, and for the benefit of every inhabitant. By applying the scientific method to social concern, RBE moves beyond the artificial scarcity and cyclical crises of monetary systems, leveraging automation, advanced technology, and ecological wisdom to create genuine abundance.

<p>
The synthesis is potent: Jesus's ethics provide the *why*—the moral imperative for a world free from suffering and exploitation. Fresco's RBE provides the *how*—the actionable, scientifically grounded methods to achieve that world. Together, they form a Universal Blueprint where compassion is systematized, and abundance is engineered, not for profit, but for peace. This is the new fresco being painted, not on a wall, but on the canvas of human civilization, guided by the highest ideals and the most rational applications.
